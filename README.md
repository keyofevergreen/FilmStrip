# üìΩ FilmStrip

Hello! This is my first pet project on Vue3.\
Features:
- Movie lists with the ability to filter by genre.
- Page with a description of the selected movie and a schedule of screenings(Available date selection window is one week).
- Modal window with a choice of seats and payment.
- Authorization (account data is stored in LocalStorage).
- Personal account with ticket history. 
- In the history of tickets, by pressing a button in tickets, you can switch to modal windows with QR codes and information about places

In my work I used [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/), [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), [ant-design-vue](https://www.antdv.com/docs/vue/introduce/), [vuelidate](https://vuelidate-next.netlify.app/) and [qrcode.vue](https://github.com/scopewu/qrcode.vue).
